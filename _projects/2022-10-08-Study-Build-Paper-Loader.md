While working at Study Build in collaboration with G2CNC, we designed a machine that streamlines the production of thermally performant cardboard boxes. Allowing us to decrease the impact of single use styrofoams in the seafood industry.

Designing the machine from the ground up allowed me to learn both hardware and software design, while developing tools to collaborate with the rest of the team.

## What

{: refdef}

- Reduce paper loading process into industrial printers
- Store paper pile allowing operators to leave machine unattended while getting live updates about machineâ€™s status
- Performed a needs analysis to initiate design process defining requirements, user driven values and KPI metrics

## How

{: refdef}

- Used 3D printing for fast prototyping (seen above) and CNC machining to manufacture the first paper loader prototype
- Fusion 360 allowed me to apply DFM principles for expensive CNC parts, decreasing manufacturing failure rates and saving resources during development
- Used 80/20 platform as a building material for flexible prototyping

## Results

- Design fulfilled its purpose by decreasing loading times from 60 to 15s.
- Increased safety of operators, while retaining high precision during paper indexing.
- Intuitive user interface for ease of operation
