While working at Study Build in collaboration with G2CNC, we designed a machine that streamlines the production of thermally performant cardboard boxes. Allowing us to decrease the impact of single use styrofoams in the seafood industry.

Designing the machine from the ground up allowed me to learn both hardware and software design, while developing tools to collaborate with the rest of the team.
