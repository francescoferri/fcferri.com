To better organize our shop, we needed a furniture system that allowed us to sort, store and transport audio equipment and electronics. Our goal was to allow users to carry equipment around based on the occasion, by giving them the option of bundling it together in modules, so they could leave behind the unnecessary gear.

## What

{: refdef}

- Create a storage solution with natural materials for transport, offices and live performances
- Allow users to pick storage configuration based on their needs

## How

{: refdef}

- Parametric equations for intuitive movements, allowing user to customize viewing angles (top module in picture)
- Intuitive slotting mechanism to secure modules to each other
- Types of modules developed with a value-based approach, based on clientâ€™s feedback (audio recording for this model)
- Using plywood and CNC machining

## Results

{: refdef}

- Implemented DFM principles to reduce milling times of assemblies, resulting in lower production costs
- Modules can be transported and assembled on-site to create the audio recording set
- Applied stress analysis to maintain a lightweight design, making modules easier to transport without compromising safety
