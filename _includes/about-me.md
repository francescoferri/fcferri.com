Hi there! My name is Francesco and I enjoy designing and building all things mechanical. I sometimes also work on software projects, like this website! My interest in mechanical things started at a young age while working on my grandpa's tractor in my home country Italy. Little did I know that interest now fuels my passion for engineering and design.
